Mm, mm
Mm
I try to live in black and white, but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true (blue)
And I'm still so blue, oh
I thought we were the same (we were the same)
Birds of a feather, now I'm ashamed
I told you a lie, désolé, mon amour
I'm trying my best, don't know what's in store
Open up the door (blue)
In the back of my mind, I'm still overseas
A bird in a cage, thought you were made for me
I try (I'm not what) to live in black and white
But I'm so blue (but I'm not what you need)
I'd like (not what you need) to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true, true
And I'm still so blue (and it's not true)
I'm true blue, true blue
I'm true blue
(Blue) mm, mm
Mm
Ah, ah
Ah
You were born bluer than a butterfly
Beautiful and so deprived of oxygen
Colder than your father's eyes
He never learned to sympathize with anyone
I don't blame you
But I can't change you
Don't hate you (don't hate you)
But we can't save you (but we can't save you)
You were born reaching for your mother's hands
Victim of your father's plans to rule the world
Too afraid to step outside
Paranoid and petrified of what you've heard
But they could say the same 'bout me
I sleep 'bout three hours each night
Means only 21 a week now
Now
And I could say the same 'bout you
Born blameless, grew up famous too
Just a baby born blue now
Now
I don't blame you
But I can't change you
Don't hate you
But we can't save you
Ooh
It's over now
It's over now
It's over now
Ah-ah
Ah
But when can I hear the next one?            </Text>

            <Text style={styles.textSong}> Do I Wanna Know? </Text>
            <Text style={styles.text}>

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow
And I play it on repeat until I fall asleep
Spillin' drinks on my settee
(Do I wanna know) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) that the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt, it's just I'm constantly on the cusp
Of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together
If you wanted to
(Do I wanna know) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) that the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
Crawlin' back to you (crawlin' back to you)
Ever thought of callin' when you've had a few? (You've had a few)
'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy)
Busy being yours to fall for somebody new (being yours)
Now I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you
(Do I wanna know) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) that the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
(Do I wanna know?) Too busy bein' yours to fall
(Sad to see you go) ever thought of callin', darlin'?
(Do I wanna know?) Do you want me crawlin' back to you? </Text>

            <Text style={styles.textSong}> Like a Stone </Text>
            <Text style={styles.text}>On a cold, wet afternoon
In a room full of emptiness
By a freeway I confess
I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death
Reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good we'll lay to rest
Anywhere we want to go
In your house
I long to be
Room by room
Patiently
I'll wait for you there
Like a stone
I'll wait for you there
Alone
And on my death bed I will pray
To the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone
Who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall
I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled
And there you led me on
In your house
I long to be
Room by room
Patiently
I'll wait for you there
Like a stone
I'll wait for you there
Alone
Alone
And on I read
Until the day was gone
And I sat in regret
Of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed
And all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death
I will wander on
In your house
I long to be
Room by room
Patiently
I'll wait for you there
Like a stone
I'll wait for you there
Alone
Alone</Text>

            <Text style={styles.textSong}> Instant Crush </Text>
            <Text style={styles.text}>I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take
One thing I never see the same when your 'round
I don't believe in him, his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the "Roche"
But no one gives us any time anymore
He asked me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us, gets in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said
"I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again
It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
That summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissors at the seem in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall
One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
Take it, I don't wanna sing anymore
"I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
I don't understand, don't get upset
I'm not with you
We're swimming around
It's all I do, when I'm with you
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
